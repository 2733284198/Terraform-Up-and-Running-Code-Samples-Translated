'Terraform: Up & Running' on Google Cloud
=========================================

The Github repository
[terraform-up-and-running-code](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code)
contains the code samples for the excellent book
[Terraform: Up & Running](http://www.terraformupandrunning.com/) by 
[Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com).
Unfortunately all examples use Amazon Web Services (AWS). Terraform also supports
other Cloud providers and this repository aims to translate the code samples of
Yevgeniy Brikman's book to Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. In the future,
other providers may be added.

* The `gcloud` folder contains code for Google Cloud Platform.
* The `azure` folder contains code for Microsoft Azure.
* The `aws/` folder contains the [terraform-up-and-running-code](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code)
  repository as a Git submodule for convenience.

The directory layouts mirrors the layout of the [terraform-up-and-running-code](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code)
repository. All code samples have been translated to mirror the original functionality
as closely as possible. Any differences are noted in README files. Code samples that don't
require any translation have symlinked.

This project is currently in the PLANNING stage.
